# Google Drive

Interact with Google Drive for file management, search, and sharing.

## Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install --user google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client keyring pyyaml
   ```

2. **Download the skill** from [Releases](https://github.com/odyssey4me/agent-skills/releases) or use directly from this repository.

## Setup Verification

After installation, verify the skill is properly configured:

```bash
python scripts/google-drive.py check
```

This will check:
- Python dependencies (google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-api-python-client, keyring, pyyaml)
- Authentication configuration
- Connectivity to Google Drive API

If anything is missing, the check command will provide setup instructions.

## Authentication

Google Drive uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication with granular scopes. You can start with read-only access and expand as needed.

### OAuth Scopes

The skill supports granular scopes for different operations:

- **`drive.readonly`** - Read files and metadata (required for list/search/download)
- **`drive.file`** - Create, modify, and delete files created by the app
- **`drive.metadata.readonly`** - View file metadata

**Read-only mode** (default): Only `drive.readonly` is required to list, search, and download files.

**Full access**: All scopes enable complete functionality including upload and sharing.

### Setup with gcloud CLI (Recommended)

**Read-only mode:**
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login \
  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
```

**Full access (recommended):**
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login \
  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly
```

**Verify authentication and check granted scopes:**
```bash
python scripts/google-drive.py check
```

The `check` command displays which scopes are available and warns if operations may fail due to missing permissions.

### Scope Errors

If you encounter "insufficient scope" errors, the skill will provide clear instructions to re-authenticate with additional scopes.

### Alternative: Custom OAuth 2.0

If you cannot use gcloud CLI, you can set up custom OAuth 2.0 credentials. See [oauth-setup.md](references/oauth-setup.md) for detailed instructions.

## Commands

### check

Verify configuration and connectivity.

```bash
python scripts/google-drive.py check
```

This validates:
- Python dependencies are installed
- Authentication is configured
- Can connect to Google Drive API
- Displays your email address and storage usage

### auth setup

Store OAuth 2.0 client credentials for custom OAuth flow.

```bash
python scripts/google-drive.py auth setup \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Credentials are saved to `~/.config/agent-skills/google-drive.yaml`.

## Drive Search Query Syntax

Common search operators:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `name contains` | Name contains string | `name contains 'report'` |
| `name =` | Exact name match | `name = 'Budget 2024.xlsx'` |
| `mimeType =` | File type | `mimeType = 'application/pdf'` |
| `'ID' in parents` | In folder | `'folder_id' in parents` |
| `modifiedTime >` | Modified after | `modifiedTime > '2024-01-01'` |
| `trashed =` | Trashed status | `trashed = false` |
| `starred =` | Starred status | `starred = true` |
| `sharedWithMe` | Shared files | `sharedWithMe = true` |

Combine operators with `and` or `or`:

```bash
# PDF files modified this year
"mimeType = 'application/pdf' and modifiedTime > '2024-01-01'"

# Spreadsheets containing 'budget'
"name contains 'budget' and mimeType = 'application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet'"

# Files in a specific folder that are not trashed
"'folder_id' in parents and trashed = false"
```

For the complete reference, see [drive-queries.md](references/drive-queries.md).

## Common MIME Types

| Type | MIME Type |
|------|-----------|
| Folder | `application/vnd.google-apps.folder` |
| Google Doc | `application/vnd.google-apps.document` |
| Google Sheet | `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet` |
| Google Slides | `application/vnd.google-apps.presentation` |
| PDF | `application/pdf` |
| Word | `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` |
| Excel | `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet` |
| PowerPoint | `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation` |
| Text | `text/plain` |
| CSV | `text/csv` |
| Image (JPEG) | `image/jpeg` |
| Image (PNG) | `image/png` |

## Troubleshooting

### Check command fails

Run `python scripts/google-drive.py check` to diagnose issues. It will provide specific error messages and setup instructions.

### Authentication failed

1. **Using gcloud**: Ensure you've run `gcloud auth application-default login` with the correct scopes
2. **Using custom OAuth**: Verify your client ID and client secret are correct
3. **Token expired**: Delete old tokens and re-authenticate:
   ```bash
   # Using gcloud
   gcloud auth application-default revoke
   gcloud auth application-default login --scopes=...

   # Using custom OAuth - tokens auto-refresh, but you can clear with:
   # (requires keyring CLI or manual deletion)
   ```

### Permission denied

Your OAuth client may not have the necessary scopes. Re-run the OAuth flow to grant additional permissions.

### Cannot download Google Docs

Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are not binary files - they cannot be downloaded directly. Use the Google Drive web interface to export them to a downloadable format (PDF, DOCX, etc.).

### Import errors

Ensure dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install --user google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client keyring pyyaml
```

### Rate limiting

Drive API has quota limits. If you hit rate limits, wait a few minutes before retrying. For high-volume usage, consider requesting quota increases in the Google Cloud Console.

## API Scopes

This skill requests the following OAuth scopes:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` - Read files and metadata
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` - Create, modify, delete files created by the app
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly` - View file metadata only

These scopes provide file management capabilities while following the principle of least privilege.

## Security Notes

- **OAuth tokens** are stored securely in your system keyring
- **Client secrets** are stored in `~/.config/agent-skills/google-drive.yaml` with file permissions 600
- **No passwords** are stored - only OAuth tokens
- **Tokens refresh automatically** when using the skill
- **Browser-based consent** ensures you approve all requested permissions

Always review OAuth consent screens before granting access to your Google Drive.
